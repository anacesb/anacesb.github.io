I'm a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering working under the guidance of Prof. Nicole Seiberlich. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master's degree in Digital Signal and Image Processing from Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú. My research interests lie at the intersection of signal and image processing, medical imaging, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, quantitative tissue characterization, and machine learning.
